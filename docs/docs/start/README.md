# Getting Started <seo/>

Welcome to :seedling:Oat++ 

## The recommended way to go

1. :point_right:Get the [High Level Overview](/docs/start/high-level-overview/). :point_left:
2. Take a look at:
   - [Step By Step Guide](/docs/start/step-by-step/) - How to create an Oat++ project from scratch. Get more low-level details. 

3. Check out [examples](/docs/start/#examples) and starter-projects:
   - [Starter Project - Simple API](/docs/start/project/)
   - [Starter project - Async API](/docs/start/project-async-api/)
   
4. :point_right:Join dev community and don't hesitate to ask questions - [chat on Gitter](https://gitter.im/oatpp-framework/Lobby):point_left::v:
